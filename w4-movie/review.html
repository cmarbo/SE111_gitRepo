            <p><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em> gives a wonderful insight into the world of fantasy by utilizing such a strong storyline as well as a exceptional cast. My fondest memory is when my father took me to the movie theaters as a young boy to see this once it came out and I absolutely loved the concept of this wizarding world.</p>
            

            <p>Although there were many changes from the book to the movie, as there always is when books have a movie counterpart, there is a reason why there is such a strong fanbase and following. The movie series truly does give a nonstop captivating performance through the storytelling and imagination.</p>

            <h3>Trivia</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>Did you know that Alan Rickman was handpicked to play Snape by J.K. Rowling and even received special instructions from her about the character?</li>
                <li>The child actors and actresses would be working on their actual school work during scenes to make the setting more real.</li>
                <li>The Hogwarts' motto, "Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus", means "never tickle a sleeping dragon".</li>
                <li>Rosie O'Donnell and Robin Williams were two of the celebrities who had asked for a role in the movie without pay, in their cases, Hagrid and Molly Weasley. They didn't get these roles, because J.K. Rowling wanted a cast strictly from the British Isles.</li>
