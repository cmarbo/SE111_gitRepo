    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello there! You have found me. My name is <b>Cameron</b> and heres a little bit about myself. I am a 7 year veteran of the Navy where I spent all of my time in the field of <i>Security</i>. I enjoy gaming, although those gaming sessions tend to be incredibly lengthy sometimes. My favorite games consist of <u>The Last of Us</u>, The Witcher 3, and Destiny 2 at the moment. Another strong hobby of mine is home cooking. Italian cuisine will always hold a special place in my heart due to the simplicity yet strong flavors within many dishes. </p>
